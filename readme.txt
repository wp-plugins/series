Adds a new taxonomy called "series" to your blog that allows you to link together several posts in a series.

== Description ==

*Series* is a plugin created to allow users to easily link posts together by using a WordPress taxonomy (e.g. tags, categories) called "series".  It can be particularly useful if you write several posts spanning the same topic and want them tied together in some way.

*Series* will automatically create archives for you and offers several ways to link your posts together.

Some features:

* A widget to list posts from a particular series.
* A widget to list posts in the same series as the current post.
* Several template tags for use within your theme.
* Two `taxonomy-series.php` templates for use with the WordPress Default theme and the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid theme framework">Hybrid theme</a>.
* Shortcodes to use within the post editor.
* And more!

**This plugin is for WordPress 2.8+ only.**

Full instructions for use can be found in the plugin's `readme.html` file, which is included with the plugin download.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `series.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

More detailed instructions can be found in the plugin's `readme.html` file.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why create this plugin? =

I originally had a function to do something similar with custom fields, but using custom fields was kind of a crude method for this.  By using the built-in WordPress taxonomy system, we get a lot of automated stuff like series archives and the ability to use built-in WordPress functions to display content.

= What does this plugin do, exactly? =

It creates a new taxonomy called "series" for use on your site.  It gives you template tags, shortcodes, and widgets to allow you to more easily tie posts together in a series.

= What widgets are available to use? =

* Series: List Posts
* Series: Related Posts

= I don't understand any of this.  What should I do? =

You should do a little reading.  The `readme.html` file included with the plugin has links to tons of resources.  Everything you need to know is there.
